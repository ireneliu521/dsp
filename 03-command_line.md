Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > $ pwd (show current working directory path)  
    $ cd (change directory)  
    $ cd .. (move up one directory)  
    $ ls (list all all files and directories in the working directory.)  
    $ mkdir 'filename' (creating a directory)  
    $ touch 'filename'.'filetype' (creating a file using `touch` command)  
    $ ls -a (listing hidden files / files starting with a dot '.')  
    $ cp 'filename' (copying a file from one directory to another)  
    $ rm -r 'directory name' or rmdir 'directory name' (deleting a directory)  
    $ rm 'filename'.'filetype' (deleting a file)  
    $ mv 'old filename' 'new filename' (renaming a file)
